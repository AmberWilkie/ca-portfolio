#### Languages and Tools
Written in HAML, an HTML interface tool, with help from Ruby, YAML and Foundation.

#### Testing with Rspec
Rspec is useful for testing the Ruby-embedded bits of the page - whether or not loops are actually looping, etc. It's not so helpful for positioning, colors, or other purely visual attributes.  
Rspec is handy if one wants to make sure the logic is functioning in complex parts of the site, particularly when the visuals may not be fully in place or fully functioning. It would allow one to trust that the elements are going to appear, when one finally gets their CSS to cooperate.
