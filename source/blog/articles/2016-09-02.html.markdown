This is a second example article. I've included some markdown stuff so I can see what all the formatting looks like:

**This is bold.**<br>
_This is italic_

# This is a two-hash headline

## This is a three-hash

### Four

#### Five hashes

##### Six hashes?

##### # SEVEN hashes!?

No, there's no seven hashes. No problem.

# Finally, just one big hash.

And some text under to see if we get that hr.
