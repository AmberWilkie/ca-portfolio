This is a second example article. I've included some markdown stuff so I can see what all the formatting looks like:

**This is bold.**  
*This is italic*

## This is a two-hash headline

### This is a three-hash  

#### Four  

##### Five hashes  

###### Six hashes?  

####### SEVEN hashes!?

No, there's no seven hashes. No problem.

# Finally, just one big hash.

And some text under to see if we get that hr.
