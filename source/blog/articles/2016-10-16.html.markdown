After a furious rush of submitted pull requests on Sunday night, we "wrapped up" the web version of [Slow Food](https://slow-food-august.herokuapp.com) and got to work on an API back end and a mobile app to consume it. We completed most of the tasks we set up for ourselves (minus checkout with Stripe because: hard). It even looks ok.

After the whirlwind week with Angular and Ionic [last time](2016-09-24.html.markdown), this week felt pretty smooth. I think we all feel much more comfortable building APIs and consuming them, and working with the Ionic framework.

One great thing about [Ionic](http://www.ionicframework.com) is that it is very beautiful out of the box, with lots of built-in styling. So if, like me, you would rather build a bunch of fun logic than fiddle with padding, you can get right to it. That pretty list up there with map icons - takes almost no effort to use. Awesome!

Starting tomorrow, we'll be done with Slow Food and working on our final project. It looks like we'll be building a quiz app for pubquiz or just palling around with your buds. We're hoping to debut it at our graduation / Halloween party at Stena Center. If you're in Gothenburg, you should come by!
